# React TypeScript Best Practices

A comprehensive reference application showcasing modern React development with TypeScript, designed to accelerate learning and adoption of industry best practices.

## üåü Overview

This project serves as both a living documentation and practical demonstration of React TypeScript best practices. It's structured as an interactive learning resource that UI developers can explore to see real-world implementations of:

- Modern React (18+) features and patterns
- TypeScript integration with React components and hooks
- Performance optimization techniques
- Component design patterns
- State management approaches
- Form handling best practices
- Data fetching patterns

## üéØ Use Cases

## üìã Featured Examples

The application includes practical demonstrations of:

### Modern React (18+) Features
- Concurrent rendering with `useTransition` and `useDeferredValue`
- Automatic batching for better performance
- Server components (with code samples)
- React 19 features preview

### TypeScript Best Practices
- Proper prop typing with interfaces
- Generic components for reusability
- Type guards and narrowing
- Utility types for React (Pick, Omit, Partial)
- Discriminated unions for state management

### Component Design Patterns
- Compound components with TypeScript
- Render props pattern
- HOC patterns with proper typing
- Controlled vs Uncontrolled components
- Component composition techniques

### Performance Optimization
- Memoization with `useMemo` and `useCallback`
- Code-splitting and lazy loading
- Virtual list implementation for large data sets
- Proper dependency arrays in hooks
- React key management best practices

### Custom Hooks Implementation
- Type-safe custom hooks
- Hooks for common UI patterns
- Animation and interaction hooks
- Data fetching with strong typing

### Form Management
- React Hook Form integration
- Validation with TypeScript
- Accessibility-first form patterns
- Complex form state management

### Data Fetching
- React Query implementation
- Type-safe API calls
- Loading/error state management
- Data caching strategies
